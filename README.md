# Hello!

Esteban Tobon
Business Intelligence Analyst | Data Enthusiast | Problem Solver

I am a recent graduate of the Business Intelligence Analyst course at TripleTen. As I embark on my career as a business analyst, I am eager to apply my skills in Google Sheets, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau to extract meaningful insights and drive business growth.

During my time at TripleTen, I worked on various projects, including a comprehensive Zomato Restaurants Analysis, which I am excited to showcase on my profile. This hands-on project allowed me to refine my analytical abilities and demonstrate my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and camping, watching sports, spending quality time with friends and family, and relaxing with a good movie. These activities help me maintain balance and foster a creative mindset.
